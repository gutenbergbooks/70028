<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We have seen that the Therapeuts listened every Sabbath to discourses on the
traditionary lore which was handed down in secret amongst themselves. <span class="smcap">Has
this secret lore passed away from the earth?</span> Scholars of the calibre
of Reuchlin Joel and M. Franck, of the Institute of France, affirm that we have
it still in the ‘Kabbalah.’ This word implies secret tradition. The legend runs
that this secret wisdom was first taught by Jehovah to the seven angels that stand
round his throne. It was then handed down orally through the seven earthly
messengers (Adam, Moses, David, &amp;c.). Finally, the Rabbi Simon Ben Jochai,
in a cavern amid earth rocking and supernatural coruscations delivered it to the
world in a <span class="smcap">“Book of Splendour,” the “Sohar.”</span>—Arthur Lillie’s “Buddhism
in Christendom” (1887).</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dr. Ginsburg speaks of the Kabbalah as:—“A system of religious philosophy,
or, more properly, of theosophy, which has not only exercised for hundreds of years
an extraordinary influence on the mental development of so shrewd a people as
the Jews, but has captivated the minds of some of the greatest thinkers of Christendom
in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, claims the greatest attention of
both the philosopher and theologian. When it is added that among its captives
were Raymond Lully, the celebrated scholastic metaphysician and chemist (died
1315); John Reuchlin, the renowned scholar and reviver of Oriental literature in
Europe (born 1455, died 1522); John Picus de Mirandola, the famous philosopher
and classical scholar (1463-1494); Cornelius Henry Agrippa, the distinguished
philosopher, divine, and physician (1577-1644); as well as our own countrymen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Page 4]</span>
Robert Fludd, the famous physician and philosopher (1574-1637), and Dr. Henry
More (1614-1687); and that these men, after restlessly searching for a scientific
system which should disclose to them ‘the deepest depths’ of the divine nature, and
show them the real tie which binds all things together, found the cravings of their
minds satisfied by this theosophy, the claims of the Kabbalah on the attention of
students in literature and philosophy will readily be admitted. The claims of the
Kabbalah, however, are not restricted to the literary man and the philosopher;
the poet, too, will find in it ample materials for the exercise of his lofty genius.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“His attempt seems to have taken a similar direction to that of George Boole
in logic, with the difference that, whereas Boole’s expression of the Laws of
Thought is algebraic, Betts expresses mind-growth geometrically; that is to say,
his growth-formulæ are expressed in numerical series, of which each can be pictured
to the eye in a corresponding curve. When the series are thus represented,
they are found to resemble the forms of leaves and flowers.”—<i>Extract from “Symbolic
Methods of Study,” by Mary Boole.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, in a characteristic article entitled, “Very Methodical
Madness,” allows that “Like Rosicrucianism, esoteric Buddhism, and other forms
of the mystically incomprehensible, it seems to exercise a magnetic influence upon
many minds by no means as foolish as its original inventor’s.”</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This work is the result of more than twenty years’ application to the discovery of
a method of representing human consciousness in its various stages of development
by means of geometrical figures—it is, in fact, the application of mathematical
symbology to metaphysics. This idea will be new to many of our readers; indeed,
so far as we know, Mr. Betts is the only man who has tried to work out a coherent
system of this kind, though his work unfortunately remains imperfect.”—<i>Theosophist</i>,

	THE MYSTERIES OF MAGIC;
</h2>

<p>A Digest of the Writings of Eliphas Levi, with Biographical and Critical Essay by
<span class="smcap">Arthur Edward Waite</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A very curious book.”—<em>Time.</em></p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To the rapidly-extending catalogue of remarkable books published by Mr.
George Redway, of London, an important addition has been made by the issue of
a digest of the writings of Eliphas Levi. Many people, we dare say, will consider
the volume to be ‘full of nonsense,’ but it is really a very curious and improving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Page 6]</span>
work, going over a vast space of ground, and presenting a great deal of matter that is
worth thinking over. The author has earned a title to be heard. As a contribution
to what is called ‘occult science,’ the present book will, of course, find a
welcome from many readers, among those especially whose passion it is to grope
for the unseen, and to these the varied contents will give delight. The matter
contained in Mr. Waite’s volume is wonderfully varied, and much of it worth
reading, even by those who do not believe in magic of any kind, black or white.”—<i>Glasgow
Herald.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“No determined student of Nature’s higher mysteries, setting out from the standpoint
of modern European culture, can afford to remain ignorant of Eliphas Levi’s
works. But to study them in the original is a wearisome task, if for no other
reason, on account of their aggregate length. The present single volume is a
digest of half a dozen books enumerated by the present author in a ‘biographical
and critical essay’ with which he prefaces his undertaking. These are the <em>Dogme
et Rituel de la Haute Magie</em>, the <em>Histoire de la Magie</em>, the <em>Clef des Grands Mystères</em>,
the <em>Sorcier de Meudon</em>, the <em>Philosophie Occulte</em>, and the <em>Science des Esprits</em>. To
attack the whole series—which, indeed, it might be difficult to obtain now in a
complete form—would be a bold undertaking, but Mr. Waite has endeavoured to
give his readers the essence of the whole six books in a relatively compact compass.”—<i>Light.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Let no man think that such transcendental mysteries as the astrologer and the
magician plunge into have disappeared from the face of the earth. Their votaries
defy derision, they meet contempt with a calm consciousness of power, and a
sublime sense of superiority; for in this generation the magicians have found a
new prophet, a new hierophant—almost a new gospel.... Meanwhile, lest our
readers should suppose that the modern students of the science of magic are not in
deadly earnest, or that they are few in number or poor in substance, let them,
with all due awe and thankfulness, buy this handsome volume, and as they open
it let them cast a glance at the amazing list of works published and publishing by
a single firm on the various branches of the occult sciences. Having done that,
let them ask themselves whether some forms of faith—for we dare not drop a hint
of disrespect—do not die hard.”—<i>Athenæum, Aug. 6th, 1887.</i></p>

	“LUCIFER:”
</h2>

<p>A Theosophical Monthly, designed to bring light “to the hidden things of darkness”
on both the physical and psychic planes of life. Edited by <span class="smcap">H. P. Blavatsky</span>
and <span class="smcap">Mabel Collins</span>.</p>

<p>This Magazine is published with a dual purpose. The first is to direct the
searching light of impartial truth on the dark problems of human life, chiefly on
the present psychic and spiritual state of our cultured classes throughout Europe
and America. The second is to apply it fearlessly as a dissecting knife to every
prejudice, whether social or religious, and as a microscope by which to reveal
the hidden essence underlying external appearances, the accepted routine of life,
forms of accustomed thought, existing institutions, sciences, and creeds. The
true light-bearer is at war with no man; but it is his duty to serve humanity by
opposing and denouncing everything which tends to hypocrisy, egotism, and the
hurt of the many for the gain of the few. “<span class="smcap">Lucifer</span>” will endeavour to carry
out this duty to the full. This is the secondary task which falls to the lot of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Page 8]</span>
who oppose the dark serried mass of materialists. But the primary one, and that
which in this Magazine will always take the first place, is that of applying theosophic
thought to the problems of life. There are things which can only be
scrutinized to any effectual purpose by the application of a higher knowledge than
that which is sufficient to deal with external facts. The Editors have the courage
to undertake so great an effort as the launching of this Magazine because they have
promise and good earnest of help, from those who possess that higher knowledge,
and who consider the time is ripe for truths, which have existed from all ages, to
be born again in the minds of men. The best known students of mysticism and
occult philosophy will contribute to its pages, while fiction, the mirror of life, will
be used to reveal some of the marvellous phases of existence. The attempt will
be not merely to promote the comprehension of inner truths and mysteries connected
with the spiritual progress of humanity, but to show that occult philosophy
may shed a new light on the practical conduct of our destinies in their relation
with the physical world.</p>

<p>“It is well for Dr. Anna Kingsford that she was not born into the sidereal
world four hundred years ago. Had that been her sorry fate, she would assuredly
have been burned at the stake for her preface to ‘Astrology Theologized.’ It is a
very long preface—more than half the length of the treatise it introduces; it
contains some of the finest flowers of Theosophical philosophy, and of course
makes very short work of Christianity.”—<i>St. James’s Gazette.</i></p>

<p>And the substance of his teachings concerning Cosmology, Anthropology,
Pneumatology, Magic and Sorcery, Medicine, Alchemy and Astrology, Theosophy
and Philosophy. Extracted and translated from his rare and extensive works and
from some unpublished Manuscripts, by <span class="smcap">Franz Hartmann</span>, M.D., author of
“Magic,” &amp;c.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Paracelsus was a high priest among mystics and alchemists; he left behind him
one hundred and six treatises upon medical and occult subjects, which are likely to
be read by the curious as long as mysticism remains a necessary study for whoever
would trace the developments of civilization.</p>

<p>“From some considerable acquaintance with the writings of Paracelsus, we can
say that Dr. Hartmann has made his excerpts from them with a good deal of skill.
Students, indeed, should be grateful for this book, despite its setting of Theosophical
nonsense; since to read one of Bombast’s Latin or German treatises is a
very stiff exercise indeed, unless you are well versed in his very recondite terminology.</p>

<p>“Dr. Hartmann has compiled a very full and accurate glossary of occult terms,
which will be of great use to future readers of Paracelsus; and for so much he is to
be thanked.</p>

<p>“Dr. Hartmann quotes some of his recipes for transmuting metals and producing
the ‘electrum magicum.’ But Paracelsus is the most transcendental of
European mystics, and it is not always easy to know when he is writing allegorically
and when practically. Dr. Hartmann says he has tried these prescriptions
and found them all right; but he warns the uninitiated against running the
risk of blowing themselves up in the endeavour to follow the master’s instructions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Page 12]</span></p>

<p>“Paracelsus held firmly to the belief of some of the hermetic writers of the
Middle Ages, that it is perfectly possible to create human beings by alchemical
means; and he even gives directions (in his treatise ‘De Natura Rerum’) for the
production of homunculi.</p>

<p>“On the whole, however, Dr. Hartmann has produced a very amusing book
and a book which will have some permanent value to the student of the occult.”—<i>St.

	THEOSOPHY, RELIGION, AND OCCULT<br>
	SCIENCE.
</h2>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Henry S. Olcott</span>, President of the Theosophical Society.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This book, to which we can only allot an amount of space quite incommensurate
with its intrinsic interest, is one that will appeal to the prepared student
rather than to the general reader. To anyone who has previously made the
acquaintance of such books as Mr. Sinnett’s ‘Occult World,’ and ‘Esoteric
Buddhism,’ or has in other ways familiarized himself with the doctrines of the so-called
Theosophical Society or Brotherhood, these lectures of Colonel Olcott’s will be
rich in interest and suggestiveness. The American officer is a person of undoubted
social position and unblemished personal reputation, and his main object is not to
secure belief in the reality of any ‘phenomena,’ not to win a barren reputation for
himself as a thaumaturgist or wonder-worker, but to win acceptance for one of the
oldest philosophies of nature and human life—a philosophy to which of late years
the thinkers of the West have been turning with noteworthy curiosity and interest.
Of course, should the genuineness of the phenomena in question be satisfactorily
established, there would undoubtedly be proof that the Eastern sages to whom
Colonel Olcott bears witness do possess a knowledge of the laws of the physical
universe far wider and more intimate than that which has been laboriously acquired
by the inductive science of the West; but the theosophy expounded in this volume<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Page 13]</span>
is at once a theology, a metaphysic, and a sociology, in which mere marvels, as
such, occupy a quite subordinate and unimportant position. We cannot now discuss
its claims, and we will not pronounce any opinion upon them; we will only
say that Colonel Olcott’s volume deserves and will repay the study of all readers
for whom the byways of speculation have an irresistible charm.”—<i>Manchester

own which compels respect, and Mr. Sinnett is so much the same as he always is,
so eager and sincere in expounding the mysteries in which he is a fervent believer,
that one seems to be inspired with some of the curious fascination of his teaching....
In spite of all the improbable and weird fancies which have to be accepted
by the student of the occult religion, it should always be borne in mind that its
tenets are eminently elevating and beautiful; that it appeals to the best side of our
nature.... But all is vague confusion to the uninitiated, and it has to be reluctantly
admitted that if attracted one is sadly dazzled by the perusal of such a couple
of volumes as ‘United.’ The purpose of ‘United’ is a good one; it is written
with marked ability, and the story is pleasantly related in the happy vein of a characteristic
author.”—<i>Morning Advertiser</i>, Dec. 31st, 1886.</p>

great deal of interesting information concerning the planting and growth of
Christianity in these islands, the origin of parishes, and the founding and endowment
of parish churches.... Mr. Clarke declares himself in his book to be a
member of the Church of England. He thus writes in no spirit of hostility to her.
But he rightly uses very plain language in giving his opinion on the wilful distortion

of the interest is disagreeable.... Yet Mr. Waite often writes very forcibly;
his imagery is good; and there is plenty of idealism in his pages.”—<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

an account of the laws relating to beer, and the statutes against drunkenness; of the

</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“With the general spirit and drift of Dr. Frederick George Lee’s vigorous
pamphlet we entirely and heartily concur. On certain points of detail we may
venture to differ from the author. Not all representations of the nude are of necessity
immodest: witness, for example, the works of such an artist as Mr. G. F.
Watts. Conversely, there are scores of pictures (chiefly French) which, though
they do not come under the category of which we speak, are nevertheless flagrantly
immodest. We deem it unnecessary to discuss the matter further, especially as
we have already and more than once expressed a very definite opinion upon it—in
substantial agreement with Dr. Lee—in the articles devoted to Art criticism. To
that opinion we intend to adhere, though in doing so we may stand alone in the
public press. As to Dr. Lee’s protest, it is, in our opinion, both timely and serviceable.”—<i>John

	THE CURATE’S WIFE.

<p class="center">
	A Novel by <span class="smcap">J. E. Panton</span>, author of “Sketches in Black and White,” “Less
	than Kin,” &amp;c.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The author of ‘Less than Kin’ has produced in ‘The Curate’s Wife’ a story
as powerful and full of genuine human interest as has appeared for some long time
past. This tale of ‘country life’ is realistic in the best sense of the word. Faithful
as a photograph in all its minor details, it shows clear insight into the character
of both the sexes, and under very varied conditions. The gradual transformation
of the heroine from a young girl, full of high purposes and enthusiasm, into the
hopeless drudge who in despair lays herself down to die, is painted with an almost
Zola-like fidelity. Her tyrant, the popular curate, is also a powerful sketch. It
is difficult not to think that an expiation worked out in the scene of his misdeeds,
with people who pity while they blame him, is insufficient punishment for so contemptible
a cur. It would have been, doubtless, more satisfactory had Meta conquered
in the unequal contest between her well-meaning inexperience and her
husband’s brutal self-love, but in real life the chances would be against her, and
this clever novel is, above all, an exact picture of certain phases of human nature
as it is, and in this lies its chief merit.”—<i>Morning Post.</i></p>

<p>“There is in the book a high and pure moral and a distinct conception of
character.... The <em>dramatis personæ</em> ... are in reality strongly individual, and
surprise one with their inconsistencies just as real human beings do.... There
is something powerful in the way in which the reader is made to feel both the
reality and the untrustworthiness of his (the hero’s) religious fervour, and the
character of the atheist, Graham, is not less strongly and definitely conceived....
It is a work that shows imagination and moral insight, and we shall look

<p class="center">
	Wayside Thoughts in Ballad and other Verse. By <span class="smcap">Two Tramps</span>.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This is a collection of short pieces, most of which can fairly be considered
poetry—no slight merit, as verses run just now. Some of the pieces are singularly
pathetic and mournful; others, though in serious guise, are permeated by quaint
humour; and all of them are of considerable merit. From the variety and
excellence of the contents of this bundle of poetical effusions, it is likely to attract
a great number of readers, and many passages in it are particularly suitable for
recitation.”—<i>Army and Navy Gazette</i>, Aug. 14, 1886.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“But ‘Low Down,’ as it is called, has the distinction of being multi-coloured,
each sheet of eight pages consisting of paper of a special hue. To turn over the
leaves is, in fact, to enjoy a sort of kaleidoscopic effect, a glimpse of a literary
rainbow. Moreover, to complete the peculiarity of the thing, the various poems
are printed, apparently at haphazard, in large or small type, as the case may be.
There are those, perhaps, who would take such jokes too seriously, and bring
them solemnly to the bar of taste, there to be as solemnly condemned. But that
is scarcely the right spirit in which to regard them. There is room in life for the
quaint and curious as well as for the neat and elegant.”—<i>Globe.</i></p>

	<span class="smcap">Preface to the New Edition.</span>
</p>

<p>Born on April 5, 1837, in the year of Queen Victoria’s accession, of which the
whole nation is now celebrating the Jubilee, Algernon Charles Swinburne to-day
attains the jubilee or fiftieth year of his own life, and may be therefore claimed as
an essentially and exclusively Victorian poet. Of the half-century of life now completed,
more than a quarter of a century has been devoted to fruitful and noble
work in song and to work hardly less fruitful and noble in the field of criticism.</p>

<p>In issuing this new edition, revised throughout and brought down to date, of a
bibliographical record originally published nearly four years ago, the compiler
cannot deny himself the pleasure of associating with the date the coincidence, not
only of a double jubilee, but also of a double birthday, viz., his own.</p>

<p>Long distant may the day be when this record, already so goodly an one, can be
made complete in a final sense, and collectors of the books of our greatest Victorian
poet and critic be able to echo Lord Melbourne’s callous expression of grateful
relief that they can bind him up!</p>

<p>As on former occasions, the compiler invites the co-operation of literary correspondents,
and will be grateful to anyone who will correct an error or supply an
omission.</p>

<p>“Thackeray’s essay ‘On the Genius of George Cruikshank,’ reprinted from the

days to despair. How inimitable is its touch! At once familiar and elegant,
serious and humorous, enthusiastically appreciative, and yet just and clear-sighted;
but, above all, what the French call <em>personnel</em>. It is not the impersonnel reviewer
who is going through his paces ... it is Thackeray talking to us as few
can talk—talking with apparent carelessness, even ramblingly, but never losing the
thread of his discourse or saying a word too much, nor ever missing a point which
may help to elucidate his subject or enhance the charm of his essay.... Mr. W.

It deals principally with the Folk-songs of Southern peoples, Venetian, Sicilian,
Armenian, Provence, and Greek Songs of Calabria, but there are several essays
devoted to the general characteristics of Folk-Poetry, such as the influence of
Nature, the Inspiration of Death, the idea of Fate, the numerous songs connected
with the rites of May, Folk-Lullabies, and Folk-Dirges. There is also an interesting
essay on what is called the White Paternoster, and Children’s Rhyming
Prayers. This is one of the most valuable, and certainly one of the most interesting,

branch of literature, to whom I heartily commend her ‘Essays in the Study of

<p>“The interest of this compilation is naturally not to be compared to that
aroused by the ever-fresh ‘Thousand and One Nights;’ but it has had high reputation
among particular admirers, and the gentleman to whom we are indebted
for this English version—apparently the most complete in any language of Western
Europe—merits the thanks of the reading public for the work performed.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A delightful addition to the wealth of Oriental stories available to English
readers is ‘The History of the Forty Vezirs’ (Redway), done into English by Mr.
E. J. W. Gibb, from the Turkish of Sheykh-Z&#257;da. The collection comprises 112
stories. To the forty told by the Lady and those of the forty Vezirs, Mr. Gibb has
added four from Belletête, twenty from a MS. in the India Office, six from Dr.
Behrnauer’s translation, and two from a MS. recently purchased by Mr. Quaritch.
The results of collation are admirably summarized in a comparative table that
analyzes the contents of the various texts. In the preface Mr. Gibb deals with the
bibliography of the French and German versions, and indicates some of the more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Page 33]</span>
interesting parallels suggested by those old stories in the ‘Gesta Romanorum,’ the
‘Decameron,’ the ‘Thousand and One Nights,’ the ‘Mabinogion,’ and other
treasures of old-world fable. In short, Mr. Gibb has considerately done everything
to help the reader to an intelligent appreciation of this charming book.”—<i>Saturday
Review.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In my opinion the version is definite and final. The style is light and pleasant,
with the absolutely necessary flavour of quaintness; and the notes, though short
and few, are sufficient and satisfactory. Mr. Gibb does not write only <em>ad clerum</em>;
and thus he has been obliged to ‘leave in the obscurity of an Eastern language’
three whole tales (pp. 353, 366, and 399), No. 2 being exceedingly witty and
fescennine. He has the good sense, when he supplants a broad joke by a <em>banal</em>
English phrase, to subjoin in a note the original Turkish (pp. 109, 140, 199, 215,
and 382). Yet some of the <em>novelle</em> are highly spiced enough: see the amorous
princess in the Eleventh Wazir’s story (pp. 381-3); and the truly Turkish and
unspeakable version of modest Æsop’s ‘Countryman and his Son.’ Of the less
Milesian I would especially commend the story of the Venus-star and the magical
angels, Harut and Marut (p. 167); the explanation of the proverb, ‘Take counsel
of the cap that is on thy head’ (p. 362), and the Thirty-seventh Wazir’s tale,
showing why ‘men have beaten their wives since the days of Saint Adam’ (p. 349).”—Sir

	MYTHS, SCENES, AND WORTHIES OF<br>
	SOMERSET.
</h2>

<p class="center">
	By <span class="smcap">Mrs. E. Boger</span>.
</p>

<p>The author has somewhat departed from her original intention of making a collection
of the myths and legends of Somerset. Unwittingly fiction glided into
fact, and the story developed into history, and it was found difficult, if not impossible,
to define their respective limits. For instance, though Arthur is an impalpable
and shadowy personage, while Alfred is a most real and substantial one, yet
the mingling of truth and fable in the story of each—as connected with Somerset—is
only one of degree; and even in later times, myth is so intertwined with the
lives of St. Dunstan, of Sir John de Courcy, of Roger Bacon, &amp;c., that, if one
tries rudely to tear away the accretions of myth and fable, a maimed and distorted
picture is all that is left.</p>

<p>Among the legends of Saints are some of rare beauty, full of earnest thought and
quaint suggestiveness. It has been endeavoured to show that, instead of being, as
they are generally and conveniently classed—with a charming simplicity—as the
“lying inventions of the monks,” they are in most cases but the loving exaggerations
of a simple age, to which every unexplained wonder was a miracle.</p>

<p>Some of the articles may be thought to be of undue length; but St. Dunstan is
a character so strangely misrepresented in most histories, that the author was
anxious to prove incontestably his claim to be one of the worthiest of the worthies
of Somerset; again, as to the unhappy Duke of Monmouth, though the story of
his rebellion is of necessity taken chiefly from Macaulay, the story of his quasi-royal
progress is little known, and Macaulay studiously omits any palliating or
softening circumstance in the terrible record of the battle of Sedgmoor and the
Bloody Assize.</p>

<p>Founded on their own Manifestoes, and on Facts and Documents collected from
the Writings of Initiated Members, by <span class="smcap">Arthur Edward Waite</span>, author of “The
Mysteries of Magic: a Digest of the Writings of Eliphas Levi.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Page 36]</span></p>

<p>Influence of the Secret Societies.—Derivations of the name Rosicrucian.—On
the State of Mystical Philosophy in Germany at the close of the Sixteenth Century.—The
Prophecy of Paracelsus.—The Fama Fraternitatis of the Meritorious Order
of the Rosy Cross.—The Confession of the Rosicrucian Fraternity.—The Chymical
Marriage of Christian Rosencreutz.—The Connection of the Rosicrucian Claims
with those of Alchemy and Magic.—On the Antiquity of the Rosicrucian Fraternity.—Theories
as to the Authorship of the Rosicrucian Manifestoes.—Progress of

<p>In the present work every important and available fact has been carefully
collected, and the manifestoes and other documents of the Fraternity are republished
in revised versions. The Rosicrucians as represented by themselves are,
therefore, offered to English readers for the first time in the literature of the
subject. The task has been performed by a sympathetic but impartial writer,
purged from the bias of any particular theory, and above all uncontaminated by
the pretension to superior knowledge, which claimants have never been able to
substantiate.</p>

</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This book is written <em>ad clerum</em>, and appeals to the scholar only, and not to the
multitude. It is a masterly and exhaustive account of that worship of the creative
powers of nature which, under various names, has prevailed among all the nations
of antiquity and of mediæval times, alike in Egypt and India, in Italy and Gaul,
among the Israelites of old, and among the primitive inhabitants of Great Britain
and Ireland ... a most valuable auxiliary to all who care to pursue such a subject
of inquiry, a subject for which Mr. Jennings is the better fitted on account of
his long and intimate acquaintance with the Rosicrucians, their tenets, and their
practices.”—<i>Antiquarian Magazine and Bibliographer.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Unpleasant as this subject is, we are quite prepared to agree that in its scientific
aspect, as a form of human worship, it has considerable importance.... Mr.
Jennings deals almost entirely with the subjective part of his inquiry, and he has
evidently made a considerable amount of research into the literature of early religions....
He has produced something which is, at all events, worth the attention
of the student of comparative psychology.”—<i>Antiquary.</i></p>

	THE DANCE OF DEATH
</h2>

<p class="center">
	In Painting and in Print, by <span class="smcap">T. Tindall Wildridge</span>. With Woodcuts.
</p>

<p>“The origin of the Dance has been conjectured to have been one of the religious
mysteries, moralities, or dramatic exhibitions which at the same time supplied a
comedy and a homily. There certainly was an acted processional dance in which
the players one by one were snatched away; Cervantes in ‘Don Quixote’ mentions
it as the ‘Cortes of Death.’ ... The earliest painting of the Dance of Death is
said to be that at Basil, though it is probable that many of which we have information
are as old. The German and Swiss bridges, so often, too, the site of
religious buildings, were decorated with the representation; an example is upon
the Pont des Moulins leading into Lucerne, where is a fine Dance, restored within
the last few years.” The blocks illustrating this work are a series found in a
northern printing office many years ago. They seem to be of considerable age,
and are somewhat close copies of Holbein’s designs.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
